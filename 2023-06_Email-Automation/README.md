# Automated Daily Email Project

This project is designed to help reduce the amount of repetitive emails that need to be sent on a daily basis. It utilizes Python and the `smtplib` library to send automated daily emails at a specified time. The email contains relevant information and can be customized based on the user's needs.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Access to an SMTP server (e.g., Gmail)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-email-project.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages.

```bash
pip install schedule
```

## Configuration

Open the script (`automated_email.py`) in a text editor and update the following variables with your own information:

```python
sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"  # replace with your Gmail address
receiver_email = "recipient_email@gmail.com"  # replace with the recipient's email address
smtp_username = "your_email@gmail.com"  # replace with your Gmail address
smtp_password = "your_password"  # replace with your Gmail password or an app-specific password
image_path = "/path/to/your/image.jpg"  # replace with the path to your image file
```

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python automated_email.py
```

The script will send a daily email at the specified time, containing the date for one week from today and a link (which can be customized). An image is also embedded in the email.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the email content, subject, and scheduling parameters according to your specific requirements. You can modify the `send_daily_email` function in the script to include different information in the email body.

## Important Notes

- Make sure to keep your Gmail credentials secure.
- Adjust the scheduling time to your preferred daily sending time.

## Disclaimer

This project assumes the use of a Gmail account and may require additional configurations for other email service providers. Use it responsibly and in compliance with the terms of service of your email provider.
